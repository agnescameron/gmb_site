## New bosses, same problems

The longest month is now over, and the year can truly begin. And what a strange, cautious, and chaotic beginning it has been.

Leaving aside the drama in Westminster, we have our own new beginnings to content with - in some cases, much as the same as before.

For one, the new company that has taken over the cleaning contract at UAL has brought with it all the problems we've come to expect from external suppliers. A shambolic transfer has left many of our members with missing pay for January, and so far the company seems more interested in shutting down our organising than rectifying the issue.

Omicron may have (fortunately) been less severe than we thought in December, but it does mean that staff will be expected to work far more from site. For many of our members who are already student-facing, this will not be news - but issues remain with regard to health and safety, mask-wearing, and a virus that is still very much with us.

## Campaign and Branch Update

The next branch meeting will be 9 February, 1-2pm, via Zoom.
Branch meetings are held on the second Wednesday of every month.

* Welcome to Alex Hitter, who was elected Youth Officer at our first meeting of the year, 12 January. Alex will be helping in promoting the union to young staff and students, as well as strengthen our ties with student's unions and relevant campaigns.
* We passed three motions to send to GMB Congress 2022. The first calls for GMB Union to commit to campaigning against outsourcing in Higher Education, the second calls for GMB Union to support the costs of care for members later in life, and the third calls for GMB Union to support a Green New Deal and Just Transition, as per the campaign pledges of GMB for a Green New Deal.
* We passed a motion in solidarity with Goldsmiths UCU, who are currently fighting against planned redundancies. The national union has called for a boycott of Goldsmiths. You can find out more via the motion, and get involved with #BoycottGoldsmiths.
* We held our first in-person site meeting of the year on Wednesday, 19 January at Camberwell. Thank you everyone for your attendance and issues raised. If you would like to arrange for a site meeting, please get in touch.
* We are looking to develop a branch website. If you would be interested in helping develop this, please get in touch.
* We have launched a survey into equalities at the branch. Please take a few minutes to fill out this short and anonymous survey to help us improve in this vital area.
* We have launched a skills audit of branch members. If you have skills you'd wish to develop or gain through undertaking paid or voluntary work for the union, please take a few minutes to fill it out.
* We have a broadcast-only WhatsApp channel. Only admins can send messages, so you will only receive notifications of branch updates and activities.
