GMB is the trade union for everyone. At the national level, GMB has over 500,000 members who work in every type of job imaginable across public services and in private companies too. Our members work in full-time jobs, part-time jobs or are working while they study.

Our branch, GMB South London Universities (SLU), currently represent employees in all job roles who labour across the following higher education institutions:

* University of the Arts London (which includes Camberwell College of the Arts, Chelsea College of the Arts, Central Saint Martins, London College of Communication, London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of the Arts)
* London Southbank University
* University of Greenwich, London

We want everybody to enjoy a safe and fair working environment, where workers’ rights are fully recognised. GMB SLU is by your side if you’re experiencing a problem at work. Our Representatives (‘Reps’) are trained in employment law, health and safety, as well as representing members in grievance and disciplinary procedures.

We can support you in the following areas:

* Workload and stress
* Parental leave, sick leave and holiday
* Bullying and harassment
* Restructures and redundancies
* Workplace adjustments
* Disciplinary and grievance procedures
* Legal support through Unionline

We are a fighting, democratic and members-led union branch. We encourage all members to take an active role, to become Reps and Officers, and to have a say in how the union is run at regular meetings and through our campaigns.

GMB SLU is a branch of GMB Southern Region. For more info and how to join, visit [https://www.gmb.org.uk/join-gmb](https://www.gmb.org.uk/join-gmb "GMB membership joining link"). If you have any questions, you can contact us at gmb@arts.ac.uk
