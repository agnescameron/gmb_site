GMB is a trade union that represents all workers.

We have over 500,000 members who work in every type of job imaginable across public services and in private companies too. Our members work in full-time jobs, part-time jobs or are working while they study.

GMB’s job is very simple: to get the best deal possible for you. The means being on your side if there is a problem, and always fighting for better when it comes to:


* Pay, terms and conditions
* A decent work life where workers are safe and treated with dignity
* Better work/life balance
* Fairness – making sure working people have their rights at work and are treated fairly and legally when there’s a problem.


When you’re at work, it’s always good to know that someone is on your side - that’s our job.
 
That’s great, but how does it work in practice?

When you’re a member of GMB, you’re part of a family that will always stand up for you. We have tens of thousands of highly trained staff and activists who understand exactly what rights you have and what employers are allowed to do.

We train our people in employment law, health and safety and how to represent people in disciplinary processes so that whenever there is a problem, someone has your back. Those activists are commonly referred to as ‘Reps’ or ‘workplace organsiers’.

On every workplace issue, from individuals facing disciplinaries, to bullying at work, to making sure you get proper maternity or paternity rights or simply making sure that your workplace is a safe place to be – GMB is here for our members.
